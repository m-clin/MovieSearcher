Movie Searcher is a web application designed for exploring and searching movies. 
Users can discover upcoming movies, search for specific titles, and filter movies by genre. 

The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, while movie data is fetched through the TMDb API. 
It features a straightforward interface where users can explore upcoming movies, search by title, view detailed information about a movie, and apply genre filters. 

Accessible through HTML files in any browser, Movie Searcher aims to provide a seamless and user-friendly movie exploration experience. 

This repository is created for the final requirement in my course IT 11.
